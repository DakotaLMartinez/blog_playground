# Getting started on a rails playground project

1. Get into the directory in your terminal where you want your project to be (using the `cd` command)
2. run `rails new blog_playground -T` to generate a new rails app without minitest (an alternative to rspec).
3. run `ls` to check that `blog_playground` is there after the `rails new` command completes.
4. run `code blog_playground` to open up the project in a separate VSCode window.
5. add all changes to git: `git add .`
6. make first commit: `git commit -m "initial commit"`
7. Create repository on github by visiting https://github.com/new 
8. Fill in the repository name (blog_playground in this case) and a description if you want, but leave the license, readme, and other checkboxes at the bottom unchecked. Create the repo and you should see blocks of code with instructions on getting started.
9. Click the clipboard by the second block of code under the heading Push an existing repository from the command line.
10. Return to VSCode terminal and paste in commands from GitHub.
11. Once previous step is complete, return to GitHub and refresh the page.
12. If all went well, you should see your code on GitHub in the browser.
